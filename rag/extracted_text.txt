predicting the stock prices. Prediction is made by building the 
regression models for a given set of independent and 
dependent variables affecting the prices of the stocks and in 
the process calculate the residuals ( Y – Y ^) for the generated 
model sets. This Product has multiple views to show the 
correlations among the selected factors viz: Heatmap, Plot 
view , Histograms. Hence a useful tool for the brokers to 
analyze the correlation.

Agile Software Development 
Bharatlogic team members has the average 
working experience of 5 years+ with scrum 
methodologies. 
We typically adopt following agile process 
for every project we do: 
1. Product Planning: At start of every 
project with client and stakeholders 
2. Sprint Planning: At start of every 
iteration with manager and 
engineers 
3. Tracking: Daily scrum standup 
meeting of team leads and 
engineers. Team updates their 
status on Trello and checks in code 
to Gits on daily basis. 
4. Demo: At end of every iterations 
with stakeholders and engineers. 
Development Process 
We at Bharatlogic provide keen attention to our 
software development process. Process becomes 
imperative for Mobil Applications because of its 
association with App markets and shorter 
gestation cycle. In order to best fit in the regularly 
changing work of app stores today we follow 
Agile methodologies and deliver in form of 
iterations/sprints. We have industry experience 
of using Agile methodologies for more than 10 
years.  
“It’s pleasure to work with Bharatlogic, 
Quality work and works fast.”                              
-Prabh,  PYZE.COM 
Our software team conducts the 3 types of test: 
Unit Tests, Integration tests and  
functional tests. We use Unit test at compile time, 
and do the integration tests to pin-point the bug's 
location better than functional tests, making it 
faster for developers to diagnose and fix. So we 
follow the healthy strategy that requires tests al 
all levels of the technology stock to ensure each 
part, as well as the system as a whole, works 
correctly. 
Project Backlog: 
The Project backlog for a typical mobile application 
consist of following tasks: 
1. Wireframe/design mock up, PSDs approval to 
client.  
2. setting up server – PHP/MySQL/ backend 
Web services  
3. Development tasks for iOS/Android  
4. IOS / Android integrations/tied-up with Web 
services for data 
5. Testing & QA 
6. Upload to Marketplaces (if required) 
Our development teams involve a number of people: 
developers, testers, designers, product/delivery 
managers, and executive stake holders. All play a role 
in the quality of the final application. While developers 
own the quality relationship with the customer, the QA 
team alerts the broader organization about risk. So our 
effective test engineers understand and empathize 
with the customer as users of the product under 
development each and every day.

As a Statistical forecasting tool MRCharts is used for 
predicting the stock prices. Prediction is made by building the 
regression models for a given set of independent and 
dependent variables affecting the prices of the stocks and in 
the process calculate the residuals ( Y – Y ^) for the generated 
modelsets. This Product has multiple views to show the 
correlations among the selected factors viz: Heatmap, Plot 
view , Histograms. Hence a useful tool for the brokers to 
analyze the correlation.

Agile Software Development 
Bharatlogic team members has the average 
working experience of 5 years+ with scrum 
methodologies. 
We typically adopt following agile process 
for every project we do: 
1. Product Planning: At start of every 
project with client and stakeholders 
2. Sprint Planning: At start of every 
iteration with manager and 
engineers 
3. Tracking: Daily scrum standup 
meeting of team leads and 
engineers. Team updates their 
status on Trello and checks in code 
to Gits on daily basis. 
4. Demo: At end of every iterations 
with stakeholders and engineers. 
Development Process 
We at Bharatlogic provide keen attention to our 
software development process. Process becomes 
imperative for Mobil Applications because of its 
association with App markets and shorter 
gestation cycle. In order to best fit in the regularly 
changing work of app stores today we follow 
Agile methodologies and deliver in form of 
iterations/sprints. We have industry experience 
of using Agile methodologies for more than 10 
years.  
“It’s pleasure to work with Bharatlogic, 
Quality work and works fast.”

Our software team conducts the 3 types of test: 
Unit Tests, Integration tests and  
functional tests. We use Unit test at compile time, 
and do the integration tests to pin-point the bug's 
location better than functional tests, making it 
faster for developers to diagnose and fix. So we 
follow the healthy strategy that requires tests al 
all levels of the technology stock to ensure each 
part, as well as the system as a whole, works 
correctly. 
Project Backlog: 
The Project backlog for a typical mobile application 
consist of following tasks: 
1. Wireframe/design mock up, PSDs approval to 
client.  
2. setting up server – PHP/MySQL/ backend 
Web services  
3. Development tasks for iOS/Android  
4. IOS / Android integrations/tied-up with Web 
services for data 
5. Testing & QA 
6. Upload to Marketplaces (if required) 
Our development teams involve a number of people: 
developers, testers, designers, product/delivery 
managers, and executive stake holders. All play a role 
in the quality of the final application. While developers 
own the quality relationship with the customer, the QA 
team alerts the broader organization about risk. So our 
effective test engineers understand and empathize 
with the customer as users of the product under 
development each and every day.
